# Air-Drawing

## Introduction

- Air drawing is a utility program that helps you draw objects in air but see them on screen.

- The project takes advantage of object tracking techniques using video analysis.

- Video analysis procedure includes 3 steps: firstly, detecting the object, secondly tracking its movement from frame to frame and lastly analyzing its behavior.

- The project focuses on developing a trajectory-based Object Detection Program

- It uses OpenCV for object detection, then follows the path of that object and mark its trajectory in real-time.
